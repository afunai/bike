          This directory contains some sample apps to show you how good Runo works.
          When you don't need them any more, you can just remove skin/examples/ directory and they will be gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may have to login to try some features of the apps. By default, there are two users.
          The first user is "root", the admin of the whole Runo app.
          The second user is "frank", who has no special privilege.
          Their initial passwords are same as their names (e.g. "root" for root, "frank" for frank).
          And of course, you can create your own account at <a href="../_users/create.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data are stored in plain YAML files under data/examples/ by default. You can store the data on any RDB by fiddling config.ru.
        </p>

            The admin (root) can post / update / delete entries and everybody can read them.
            Typical features such as monthly archives or syndication by RSS are provided.
            You have to login as "root" to post new articles.
          </dd>

            This is an example of inheritance.
            By simply making an empty sub-directory (blog/frank/), all HTMLs are inherited from the upper directory (blog/).
            Then, blog/frank/index.yaml overrides the label ("Frank's Blog") and the admin (frank).

          <dt><a href="./contact/">Contact Form</a></dt>
          <dd>
            This is an "everybody -> admin" type app.
            Everybody other than root can post this form and only root can see the posted result.
            The index.html is a good sample of various items such like radio, select, checkbox etc.
          </dd>
          <dt><a href="./forum/">Forum</a></dt>
          <dd>
            This is an example of a nested model.
            The app will have many posts, and each post will have many comments.
            Everybody who logged in can create a new post, or reply to a existing post.
